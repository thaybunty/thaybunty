ABOUT PROJECT:

My project does not compile at a whole since I have tried to fix it a lot of times, so I think 
I don't have a good set of program that I tested my project. I am really sorry for these hardships. 
A few coincidences happened to me this semester. 

    At first, this is the first time I implement an interpreter in Ocaml so I can't make my project run successfully. 
I run my project, add more functions, and type, then it crashed immediately. But I tried to complete all the requirement 
of the project even thought I know that my whole project would not run.

///I am really apologize in advance for this, but I have to let you know my difficulty //////

    Secondly, my big brother died in February (a few weeks after the class started) in Cambodia because of the new 
variant of Covid-19 which impacted to my feeling a lot. I could not go to his funeral because my country was lockdown until
now. The government did not allow people to come in and out of the country. Then, the same reason happened again to my cousin 
two weeks ago which really made me more depressed. every day I am trying to focus study, but I can't make it because everything
is on my brain and I can't forget it. 

    Finally, I am really sorry for this project that it does not compile at a whole. I hope you understand my difficulty. 
And no matter how much score I get at the end of the semester, I will try my best to finish the semester because I 
really want to pass the class. 

Thank you!!!
